        <!--Employment/Education resources - Getting a roof over our heads is always important, but keeping a roof requires money. Employment helps with that. Finding employment friendly to felons is not easy, but luckily there's a lot of help out there. From companies that provide daily pay for picking up trash on the freeways (and they help with finding full time jobs too!) to companies providing full time employment you'll find them all listed here.  In addition, educational resources are included here as well. Finished your AA/AS degree in prison and now you're ready to get your BA/BS, let's get started!  Do you want vocational training, there are resources for that here as well!-->
