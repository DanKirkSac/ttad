        <h2 class="text-warning">Finding housing can be difficult for anyone, but returning citizens face many unique challenges. These housing resources listed here come in a variety of types. Transitional housing provides short term solutions and a wide range of programs that help prepare the returning citizen for the regular world. Pay to stay housing provides inexpensive room-sharing options, many of them sober living environments, and fewer restrictions for a moderate price. City and local organizations offer assitance for a wide variety of situations. If you need housing, hopefully one of the organizations listed here can help.</h2>
